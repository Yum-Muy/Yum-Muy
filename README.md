## Someday I'll be adding notable (enough) stuff here ðŸ”¥<br />
<br />
Just a person who wants to learn coding of all types, but mostly game development<br />
I know a fair amount of Python, Java, and GDscript, and I'm currently learning C++<br />
Someday I'll actually finish some engines I've been working on for some games I really like<br /> 
Yeah thats about it for no w<br />
